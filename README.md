Semi-automated pipeline for lens modeling based on
[`lenstronomy`](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy).

## Features

-   Semi-automated modeling of a large sample of quasar and
    galaxy-galaxy lenses.
-   Joint multi-band lens modeling.
-   Easy portability between local and HPCC environments.
-   Initial fitting recipe for galaxy-galaxy lenses for faster
    convergence.
